I am an assistant professor at Utrecht University. My research revolves around decisions by experience, that is, how learning depends on previously encountered information. I am interested in decision-making and sampling in a broader social cognition framework.

My teaching revolves around social psychology and statistics classes. I teach mainly in the Bachelor program, but also in the (research) master program, at the University College, and supervise theses.
